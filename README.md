author: Xing Hu, Hailun Tian

Description:
A Carer System to monitor user's health

The system to be produced is part of a fictional fitness monitoring device called the FatBat1.
A FatBat looks like a wristwatch and includes functions for monitoring the wearer’s health and uploading this 
information into a cloud-based system. It monitors heart rate and uses GPS locations and footsteps to measure a person’s activity and fitness.

The FatBat has four intended features:
1. to record a person’s vital signs
2. to inform emergency services when a person su↵ers from a cardiac arrest (as judged by irregularities in heart beat),
3. to share some limited information with an insurance company, in order to reduce premiums, and
4. to share information with friends for social reasons; e.g. competitions to see who can take the most steps.

Each FatBat’s data is stored in the cloud. Each user can set access permissions to their own data, described below.
You are tasked with designing and implementing part of the FatBat cloud user administration sub-system and its cloud storage that communicates
just the right amount of information to just the right people at the right times.
